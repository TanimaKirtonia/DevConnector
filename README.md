learning to develop a social media application using MERN stack. 
currently just following the course videos from udemy.com of the course: "MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js" by Brad Traversy. 
I am later planning to use this knowledge to apply to my own project titled "Stray Pawsitive"
